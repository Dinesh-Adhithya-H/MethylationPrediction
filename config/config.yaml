  PYTHON_DIR: "workflow/scripts/" # The directory of the python files which are used in the snakefile.

HOME_DIR: "/project/ReadStatistics-data/MethylationPrediction/" # where your codes and snakefile sits.

FILES_DIR: "/project/ReadStatistics-data/MethylationPrediction/bam_files/" # The directory where the bam files live.
MODEL_DIR: "workflow/models/model2.joblib" # The name of the machine learning model to predict methylation state of CpG Islands or where to save the model in training mode.
OUTPUT_DIR: "/project/ReadStatistics-data/MethylationPrediction/results/" # The directory where the output files are stored at.

FASTA_FILE_DIR: "/project/ReadStatistics-data/MethylationPrediction/resources/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa" #Fasta file
CpG_ISL_BED_FILE_DIR: "resources/CpG_isl_hg38.bed" # Bed file of the CpG islands
REMOVE_READS_DIR: "resources/remove_reads.bed" # Remove reads which are bad

TXT_FILE_DIR: "config/file_links.txt" # The file which contains the links to the bam files
FASTA_FILE_LINK: "http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/GRCh38_reference_genome/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa" # Link to the fasta file
METHYLATION_ANNOTATION_DIR: "resources/hg38_methylation_level.bed" # The csv file which contains the methylation state of the CpG islands

MODE: "predict" # train or predict mode. If train, the model will be trained and saved. If predict, the model will be loaded and used to predict the methylation state of the CpG islands.
RATIO: "None" # ratio of number of methylated CpG islands to number of unmethylated CpG islands. If None, the ratio will be calculated from training dataset.
SAMPLE_TYPES: "SAME" # Whether the samples belong to the same tissue or not. If SAME, the samples belong to the same tissue. If DIFFERENT, the samples belong to different tissues.
